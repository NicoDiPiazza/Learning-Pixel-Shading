# Learning-Pixel-Shading
some work I'm doing inspired by Acerola YT

In python mostly, each file is a new project designed to work closely with a new aspect of the pixel reading and writing features in python. The early files are only focused on reading and adjesting macro colors of objects, wheras later ones are closer to real proper shaders, and working more in depth, lower level with the graphics capabilities of computers.
